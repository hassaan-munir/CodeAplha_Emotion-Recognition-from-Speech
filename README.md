# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

-----

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **deep learning model** to identify human emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) from speech audio samples. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to accurately classify emotional states from vocal cues. [cite\_start]This project was developed as a task during my **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**. [cite: 13, 3, 5]

## Dataset

[cite\_start]The model was trained and evaluated using the **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset**. [cite: 15] This comprehensive dataset contains recordings of actors speaking various sentences in different emotional states.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle:

## Methodology

The development process followed a standard Machine Learning and Deep Learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**
      * The RAVDESS dataset was loaded and processed.
      * Audio files were padded to a consistent length to ensure uniform input for feature extraction.
2.  **Feature Extraction:**
      * **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** were extracted from each audio file. [cite\_start]MFCCs are powerful features that represent the unique spectral characteristics of speech relevant to emotion. [cite: 15]
      * Each audio file was transformed into a fixed-size MFCC feature vector.
3.  **Data Preparation:**
      * Emotion labels (e.g., 'happy', 'angry') were converted into a numerical, **One-Hot Encoded** format suitable for deep learning classification.
      * The dataset was split into training and testing sets (75% training, 25% testing) to ensure robust model evaluation on unseen data.
4.  **Model Architecture & Training:**
      * A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was designed and implemented. [cite\_start]CNNs are well-suited for pattern recognition in sequential data like audio features. [cite: 15]
      * The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
      * **ModelCheckpoint** and **EarlyStopping** callbacks were utilized to save the best performing model and prevent overfitting during training.
5.  **Model Evaluation:**
      * The trained CNN model's performance was rigorously evaluated on the test set.
      * [cite\_start]Key metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** were calculated. [cite: 12]
      * A **Confusion Matrix** was generated to provide a visual breakdown of the model's classification performance across different emotion categories.

## Key Results

The trained CNN model achieved an impressive **\~[Apni best accuracy yahan likho, maslan 94.7%] accuracy** on the test set. This demonstrates the model's strong capability in distinguishing between various human emotions from speech audio. The classification report further highlighted high precision, recall, and F1-scores across most emotion classes, indicating robust performance.

## Technologies Used

  * [cite\_start]**Python**: The primary programming language. [cite: 3]
  * **Librosa**: For audio processing and feature extraction (MFCCs).
  * **Soundfile**: For reading and writing audio files.
  * [cite\_start]**TensorFlow / Keras**: For building, training, and evaluating the deep learning (CNN) model. [cite: 3, 15]
  * [cite\_start]**Scikit-learn**: For data splitting, label encoding, and comprehensive model evaluation metrics. [cite: 3]
  * **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.
  * **Pandas**: For data handling and structuring (though less prominent in this specific notebook's snippet, it's generally used).
  * **Matplotlib**: For plotting training history and confusion matrices.
  * **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical data visualization.
  * **Google Colab**: Used as the development environment, leveraging its cloud resources and GPU capabilities.

## How to Run

To run this project:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hassaan-munir/CodeAlpha_Speech_Emotion_Recognition.git
    cd CodeAlpha_Speech_Emotion_Recognition
    ```
    *(Replace `hassaan-munir` with your actual GitHub username)*
2.  **Download the Dataset:**
      * Go to the RAVDESS dataset page on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/ravdess-emotional-speech-speech-emotion](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/ravdess-emotional-speech-speech-emotion)
      * Download the dataset (`RAVDESS_Speech_Emotion_Recognition.zip`).
      * Extract the contents. You should find an `archive` folder inside.
      * Upload the `archive` folder (containing `Actor_01` to `Actor_24` subfolders, possibly nested within `audio_speech_actors_01-24`) to your Google Drive, preferably in a `Colab Notebooks` folder or similar, matching the `DATA_PATH` in the notebook.
3.  **Open in Google Colab:**
      * Upload the `Emotion Recognition from Speech.ipynb` notebook to Google Colab.
      * Ensure your Google Drive is mounted (`from google.colab import drive; drive.mount('/content/drive')`).
      * Verify and adjust the `DATA_PATH` variable in the notebook to point to your `archive` folder in Google Drive.
4.  **Install Libraries & Run:**
      * Run the first cell to install all required libraries (`!pip install ...`).
      * Run all subsequent cells sequentially to load data, extract features, build, train, and evaluate the model.
